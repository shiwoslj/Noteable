carloscasa-mid-century-modern-chair-vanity-chair-faux-cashmere-for-living-room,published,5,Perfect mid-century modern chairs,Gabriela,,,I was worried about the chairs looking cheap because of the metal but i absolutely love them! A major plus is that they’re soooo easy to assemble (unlike Ikea furniture) and they seem very sturdy too. I would 10/10 recommend,,2022-6-16 06:08,
carloscasa-mid-century-modern-chair-vanity-chair-faux-cashmere-for-living-room,published,5,Very Impressed!,M & E,,,"I bought many of these mid-century modern chairs for bedroom, study, dining room, living room, modern minimalist design, suitable for most occasions better than I expected! I assembled them myself even though it would be faster with two people to aline the screws but overall it was easy. Instructions are clear and the chair's quality feels sturdy. I am impressed and like the look. I would recommend it.",,2022-6-17 20:31,

caroloscasa-end-table-side-table-c-shape-sofa-table-slide-under-couch-sofa-for-living-room-and-bedroom,published,5,Great coffee table for working from sofa,TechieBayArea,,,"This table is just suitable for the sofa that I am working with. It’s Hugh enough so that you don’t have to bend your neck at an awkward angle to look at your laptop. It’s on a taller side compared to other tables I saw. The frame is sturdy.

The top has superior Acrylic. The area is good enough for a 15-inch laptop. Overall it’s a good work/ coffee table for your workspace.",,2022-9-11 20:08,
wassily-inspired-chair-midcentury-modern-accent-vantage-folding-for-living-room,published,5,"Hey, I'm really please with this.",TruthGoer,,,"I had a Wassily reproduction for 40 years. Loved it but two leather straps broke and it was easier to replace than fix. (note when I put the old one out on the street in came off and on the street a number of times as others considered repairing it). Yes, it's a design icon, and stylish ... but ... no other chair serves the purpose while not cramping the space that it sits. It's just chrome bars and straps. It doesn't ""close in"" the room at all. And hey, I'm picky, I didn't want some flimsy, cheesy chair in my home. I very carefully unwrapped the box it came in because it was going back if I didn't like it. But it's great! I'm very pleased. A great chair at a great price. And it is very comfortable in a supportive and body-positive way.",,2022-9-22 12:07,
wassily-inspired-chair-midcentury-modern-accent-vantage-folding-for-living-room,published,5,Wassily-type chair,Phillip P.,,,This chair is more of a fashion piece than one designed for a night of comfy movie streaming. I’m not quite certain what the difference is in a Wassily and a Wassily-type chair. I had a black Wassily chair for approximately 30 years that just wore out. I purchased this Wassily-type black leather and chrome chair for approximately $799.99. I believe that an advertised Wassily sells for about $1100. I’m hopeful that someone can explain the difference. I enjoyed my Wassily chair for decades. and I’m hopeful that I’ll be able to enjoy my Wassily-type chair for many years.,,2022-9-22 12:08,
wassily-inspired-chair-midcentury-modern-accent-vantage-folding-for-living-room,published,5,"Your Grandma's Chair, Actually",VBSWETE,,,"I had these, which, were a reproduction then, back in the 70s. I didn't know their history of them then. I think I was in a real minority of anyone in town that had one. It had been years when I ran across them on here and couldn't get over how I could get one of them, again, and, so, I bought one. The other one I bought somewhere else due to a better price, but, it's the same thing. They arrive in better shape than the package looks. As anyone else knows you cringe when looking at the box wondering how beat up they are going to be, but, they are just fine. I just wiped them down.
The rest of the critique others have done just fine writing about the design and the history of this chair.",,2022-9-22 12:11,

wassily-inspired-chair-midcentury-modern-accent-vantage-folding-for-living-room,published,5, All around success,Charles Graff,,,Arrived well packed & packaged. No damage to either chair. These are by far the least expensive wasily chair I could find so was wondering why so cheap. I am still wondering. These chairs are solid and beautiful. Very happy.,,2022-9-22 12:15,
wassily-inspired-chair-midcentury-modern-accent-vantage-folding-for-living-room,published,5,Beautiful and reasonable.,Michael A. Lee,,,"Overall the chair received a 5 star. If there was a half star I would have given comfort and thickness a 4.5. The original has a little heavier leather and a slightly deeper seat angle. The price for this piece was amazing, and the look is perfect for my living room design.",,2022-9-22 12:16,

Despite appearances, it's amazingly comfortable to sit in and looks awesome in our mid-century modern living room. Fans of Frasier will recognize this from his apartment. All our guests comment on both the appearance and comfort of this chair. If you want a mid-century modern look, this is an inexpensive add-on to your room.",,2022-9-22 12:18,
